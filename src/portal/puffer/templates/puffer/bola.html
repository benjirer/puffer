    <div class="row justify-content-md-center">
      <div class="col-md-10 text-justify">
        <p> One ABR algorithm implemented on Puffer is BOLA-BASIC, the simplest
          variant of BOLA. BOLA finds wide use in industry, notably in the
          MPEG-DASH reference player used as the basis for video players at
          Akamai, BBC, Orange, and CBS<a href="#footnote-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.
          The overall goal of BOLA is to maximize
          each encoded chunk’s video quality while minimizing rebuffering. To
          measure video quality, Puffer uses the structural similarity metric
          SSIM, whereas BOLA and other ABR algorithms like BBA, MPC, and Pensieve
          are more commonly implemented using bitrate (or a variant of bitrate). </p>

        <p> While bitrate is frequently used, BOLA allows the video provider to
          define its own proxy of video quality as the algorithm’s "utility"
          function. However, using SSIM as utility proved surprisingly complex for
          BOLA-BASIC, despite the algorithm’s simplicity. Given the rising
          popularity of SSIM and related quality metrics, we anticipate that a
          growing number of Puffer-like systems will face similar challenges. We
          hope developers of such systems find our experiences informative as they
          implement algorithms designed with bitrate-based utility in mind. </p>

        <br>
        <h5>Background: SSIM and video quality</h5>
        <hr>
        <p> ABR algorithms like BOLA decide the bitrate at which to download each chunk
          of video into the client’s buffer. As the throughput of the network varies, the
          goal is to minimize stalls caused by an empty buffer while choosing
          high-quality encodings (see the <a href="{% static 'puffer/documents/puffer-paper.pdf' %}">
            Puffer paper</a> for more background on
          ABR). Much recent work has focused on objective metrics for an
          encoding’s subjective quality. Measuring perceived video quality is
          difficult, and no metric is perfect. Recently, Netflix’s VMAF has
          attempted to combine the strengths of several metrics by using them as
          input to a machine-learning model<a href="#footnote-1"><sup>2</sup></a>. </p>

        <p> In the BOLA paper and DASH player, the "utility" metric that
          measures video quality is the normalized logarithm of encoded chunk
          size. Using size as utility is effectively equivalent to using bitrate
          and is a common choice. Bitrate is also easily computed, and is already
          made available to the ABR logic in DASH and other streaming
          protocols<a href="#footnote-1"><sup>3</sup></a>.
          However, video quality does not correlate directly with
          bitrate<a href="#footnote-1"><sup>3</sup></a>. When
          the content of a video changes over time, like the live TV streamed on
          Puffer, some chunks are easier to encode than others. For instance, a
          stream may have a black screen for several seconds, followed by a
          fast-moving scene. The all-black chunks can be encoded more efficiently
          than the scene, so they are likely to both look better <i>and</i> be smaller
          than more complex chunks. </p>

        <p> SSIM<a href="#footnote-1"><sup>4</sup></a>
          is one of many metrics that attempt to capture this variation.
          Unlike bitrate, SSIM is a compute-intensive metric, and Puffer is
          unusual in providing it at runtime. In fact, 18 of Puffer’s cores are
          solely devoted to SSIM. Many systems use metrics like SSIM, or the older
          PSNR, to evaluate chunks <i>after</i> they are chosen by the ABR algorithm.
          However, to our knowledge Puffer is the first study to use SSIM or PSNR
          as a factor in the ABR decision. </p>

        <br>
        <h5>BOLA-BASIC on Puffer</h5>
        <hr>
        <p> Unlike many other ABR
          algorithms, BOLA-BASIC is very simple in implementation. The objective
          is a function of each encoded chunk’s utility and size, along with the
          buffer level and two control parameters. If the buffer is not too full,
          the algorithm chooses the encoded chunk with the highest objective.
          Otherwise, BOLA elects not to download any chunk before the next
          decision opportunity<a href="#footnote-1"><sup>1</sup></a>. </p>

        <p> The first implementation of BOLA-BASIC on Puffer was a direct
          representation of the algorithm as presented in the
          paper<a href="#footnote-1"><sup>1</sup></a>, using SSIM
          in decibels (SSIMdB) as the utility function. Puffer also uses SSIMdB to
          measure video quality in the other ABR algorithms implemented on the
          platform, as well as to measure their performance (in conjunction with
          stall ratio). </p>

        <br>
        <h5>A less basic BOLA-BASIC</h5>
        <hr>
        <p> The BOLA authors shared
          their expertise to help optimize the initial implementation of
          BOLA-BASIC. This resulted in three changes. </p>

        <p> The first two changes related to BOLA’s decision thresholds, i.e.
          the buffer levels at which BOLA changes its bitrate decision. At the
          first threshold, BOLA switches from choosing the smallest to the
          second-smallest encoding. At the last threshold, BOLA switches from the
          largest chunk to no chunk at all. </p>

        <p> The decision thresholds in the average case are shown in Figure 1.
          BOLA’s control parameters <i>V</i> and <i>ɣ</i> are calculated statically, using
          long-term averages for the utility and size of each of the ten encoded
          formats. So, Figure 1 shows the decisions BOLA would make if the ten
          options produced by the encoder at some time slot exactly matched the
          averages used to calculate the parameters. Puffer uses 3 and 15 seconds
          for minimum and maximum buffer size, which correspond to the first and
          last thresholds in the average case. </p>

        <div class="text-center">
          <img class="img-max-800" src="{% static 'puffer/dist/images/bola/average-objectives-decisions-v1.svg' %}">

        <p> <b>Figure 1.</b> Decision thresholds for average SSIM/sizes in
          BOLA-BASIC "v1". Dashed lines mark min/max buffer level. Thresholds
          beyond max buffer are hypothetical. </p><br>

        <p> Figure 2 shows the thresholds over a 10-minute CBS clip, using the
          naive implementation of BOLA-BASIC. Each line corresponds to the
          encodings produced for one chunk. Notice that many of the thresholds
          appear above the maximum buffer level of 15 seconds. </p>

        <div class="text-center">
          <img class="img-max-800" src="{% static 'puffer/dist/images/bola/cbs-decisions-v1.svg' %}">
        </div>

        <p> <b>Figure 2.</b> Decision thresholds for BOLA-BASIC "v1" over a
          10-minute clip. Each line represents a single 120-frame chunk. Dashed
          lines mark min/max buffer level. Thresholds beyond max buffer are
          hypothetical. </p><br>

        <p> Since BOLA elects not to send a chunk at buffer levels above the
          maximum, BOLA will never exercise any of the thresholds beyond 15
          seconds. To mitigate the appearance of such thresholds, the authors
          suggested two modifications to the utility function. </p>

        <p> The first change in BOLA-BASIC "v2" is to use the raw value of SSIM,
          without converting to decibels. Although the data correlating SSIMdB
          with perceived quality is noisy, there is some evidence that the decibel
          transformation creates an approximately linear relationship with human
          preference<a href="#footnote-1"><sup>5</sup></a>.
          However, the transformation to decibels expands the values
          in the upper SSIM range, as shown in Figure 3. </p>

        <div class="text-center">
          <img class="img-max-600" src="{% static 'puffer/dist/images/bola/SSIM-dB-vs-raw.svg' %}">
        </div>
        <p> <b>Figure 3.</b> Conversion of SSIM to decibels is asymptotic in
          the upper range. </p><br>

        <p> As a result, the utility of higher-quality encodings is inflated
          using SSIMdB relative to SSIM, pushing the thresholds to the right. So,
          the BOLA authors expected the algorithm to behave better with raw SSIM.
        </p>

        <p> As a second adjustment to the utility function, the authors
          suggested using the maximum <i>possible</i> utility (i.e. 1.0 for raw
          SSIM) in the parameter calculations, rather than the maximum
          <i>average</i> utility. On average, the highest-quality encoding
          available is 0.983, so using 1.0 instead is a significant change.
        </p>

        <p> As shown in Figure 4, most of the decision thresholds shift below
          the maximum buffer size after making these two changes. </p>

        </div>
        <p> <b>Figure 4.</b> Updated version of Figure 2 for
          BOLA-BASIC "v2". </p><br>

        <p> Separately, the authors suggested a third change, relating to the
          case where the objective is negative for all available encodings. In
          this situation, the DASH reference implementation pauses until the
          buffer has drained enough so that some objective is non-negative. Puffer
          implements ABR on the server, so this pause was simulated to avoid
          introducing BOLA-specific logic in the server. Specifically, the authors
          suggested that if all objectives are negative, BOLA-BASIC "v2" should
          choose the chunk with highest utility rather than highest objective.
          This simulates the client’s pause, since the point at which the
          objective becomes positive is a factor only of utility, not the size in
          the denominator (see Figure 5). </p>

        <br>
        <h5>BOLA-BASIC and SSIM</h5>
        <hr>
        <p> The changes in the second
          implementation of BOLA-BASIC on Puffer do not address a fundamental
          issue with the use of SSIM (whether decibels or raw) in BOLA. The BOLA
          parameters are calculated statically, but SSIM varies dynamically with
          bitrate. According to the paper, BOLA can use any utility function as
          long as the utility of the available encodings for each chunk is
          nondecreasing with respect to their size. In fact, the paper identifies
          the ability to define utility in "very general" ways as a unique
          strength of BOLA. SSIM satisfies BOLA’s requirement of monotonicity
          w.r.t. size <i>within</i> the encodings for each chunk (120 frames on
          Puffer). However, as discussed above, utility can vary independently of
          size, and therefore bitrate, <i>across</i> chunks. </p>

        <p> Unlike direct functions of bitrate, SSIM captures this variation.
          However, this causes BOLA to behave very differently when choosing
          between a set of format options with low utility than when choosing
          between higher-quality chunks. Due to the way utility is used in BOLA’s
          objective (Figure 5), when utility is near <i>-ɣp</i>, a small gain in utility
          can outweigh a large bitrate increase, particularly if the buffer is
          near empty. For instance, BOLA could prefer a format twice as large
          offering only a 0.4dB SSIM increase. While downloading this much larger
          chunk, the near-empty buffer may drain completely. In contrast, when
          choosing between chunks whose utility is larger in magnitude relative to
          <i>-ɣp</i>, the same utility gain has less impact relative to the bitrate
          difference.
        </p>

        <div class="text-center">
          <img class="img-fluid" style="width: 200px"
            src="{% static 'puffer/dist/images/bola/objective-function.svg' %}">
        </div>
        <p> <b>Figure 5.</b> BOLA’s objective. <i>V</i> and <i>ɣ</i> are control
          parameters, <i>p</i> is chunk duration, <i>Q(t<sub>k</sub>)</i> is buffer level,
          <i>S<sub>m</sub></i> is size, and <i>v<sub>m</sub></i> is utility.
        </p><br>

        <p> It seems that the static parameter
          calculation inherent to BOLA is fundamentally incompatible with a
          utility function involving variables beyond bitrate. It’s
          interesting that the variation of SSIM with bitrate is a strength
          of SSIM as a utility metric, but makes SSIM less amenable to
          algorithms based on more approximate utility metrics. </p>

        <br>
        <h5>Results</h5>
        <hr>
        <p> Figure 6 shows the performance of the
          initial "v1" implementation of BOLA-BASIC, as well as the "v2"
          implementation with the three changes discussed above. Also shown are
          BBA and two ML-based ABR algorithms developed on Puffer. Each of the
          five algorithms has over 3.5 cumulative stream-years of data. </p>

        <div class="text-center">

          <img class="img-max-600" src="{% static 'puffer/dist/images/bola/results-slow.svg' %}">
        </div>
        <p> <b>Figure 6.</b> Performance of both versions of BOLA-BASIC on Puffer (95%
          confidence intervals), for all stream speeds (top plot) and slow
          streams only (bottom plot). Both plots show data from 2020-07-26 to
          2020-11-07 (see the <a href="{% url 'results' %}">Experiment Results</a> page for latest
          data). All speeds comprises 685,022 streams (17.7 stream-years);
          slow speeds comprises 96,646 streams (1.5 stream-years). </p><br>

        <p> The two versions of BOLA-BASIC are broadly similar at this
          timescale, with "v2" showing slight improvement in SSIMdB and stall
          ratio. Relative to BBA, both versions improve SSIMdB while increasing
          stall time. </p>

        <br>
        <h5>Conclusions</h5>
        <hr>
        <p> It should be noted that BOLA-BASIC is considerably simpler than
          production implementations of BOLA, e.g. BOLA-E and BOLA-O in the DASH
          reference player. Also, Puffer has several architectural differences
          from DASH and other client-side players (see the
          <a href="{% static 'puffer/documents/puffer-paper.pdf' %}">Puffer paper</a> for
          detail). For these reasons, we don’t intend to present these results as
          a comment on the general performance of BOLA relative to the other
          algorithms. Instead, we see these results as an indication of the
          surprising complexity possible when using SSIM in even the simplest ABR
          algorithms.
        </p>

        <p> Newer video quality metrics like SSIM more accurately reflect human
          perception. However, existing ABR algorithms may not always be designed
          to take full advantage of these metrics. If measurements like SSIM are
          the future of ABR, Puffer will not be alone in facing these challenges.
        </p>
